# Why TOF-SIMS ?
We needed a convenient way to explore the 3D datasets generated by a TESCAN FERA Xe plasma FIB-SEM with ToF-SIMS.  The software provided by the manufacturer did not provide these functions.

# Highlights
Some of the functions available so far:
* Read data from TOF-SIMS (.HDF5) files, making the data directly accessible in * Python (numpy/pandas/matplotlib).
* Generate top, sides projections
* Plot surface before FIBing
* Plot detected masses
* Quickly generate maximal projections for a given axis (x,y,z) and every isotopes/masses (usefull to have a quick look at detected species).
* Inspect top, side and depth projections for a given isotope/mass
* Plot (and superpose) the abundance of species over any axis.
* Generate overlays of maximal projections (e.g. overlay top-projection for masses 27, 28 and 48)
* Read in the complete header of the file. Get access to every setting of the machine recorded at the time of the experiment. This includes:
